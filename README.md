## Install

Ofont is based on ProcessWire, those information will help you to install it.

1. Download the last version of [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com/) then unzip it to another location.

2. Before installing ProcessWire, rename the folder `/site-default/` to `/site/` then copy and paste the following files from ofont directory to ProcessWire directory:

        /site/install/
        /site/templates/
        /site/modules/
        /site/config-example.php


3. Delete the existing `config.php` and rename the file `config-example.php` to `config.php`.

4. Create a new dedicated SQL database using [PhpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php).

5. After you've completed the steps above, run the installer `/install.php` for the new site by loading it in your browser and follow the instructions.

## When Finished

It's not good to leave the exported profile lying around as it may be consuming quite a bit of disk space. As a result, I recommend that you remove the profile when done with all of the above steps (`/site/install/install.sql`).

## Customise

Ofont uses [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) for CSS compiling, and [Fontello](http://fontello.com/) to generate icon font.

## Update to the latest ofont version

Ofont is still in development, so it may regularly come new features. To update your ofont to the latest available version follow those steps :

1. First of all, for safety it is recommended to backup your database.

2. Copy and paste these files from the latest ofont directory to your current directory:

        /site/templates/
        /site/modules/

3. In your ProcessWire admin, go to `Admin->Modules` then click *Check for New Modules*. If new modules are found, install it.

4. Copy the content of `/updateFiles/fields.txt` from the latest ofont directory and paste it to `Admin->Setup->Fields->Import` in your ProcessWire admin. Click *Preview* then agree to every changes.

5. Copy the content of `/updateFiles/templates.txt` from the latest ofont directory and paste it to `Admin->Setup->Templates->Import` in your ProcessWire admin. Click *Preview* then agree to every changes.

6. Enjoy!
